        <h3>Culminating NSTP: Addressing RA 11313 and Violence Against Women and Children </h3>

        The National Service Training Program (NSTP) provides students with opportunities to engage in community development and social issues. One of the most pressing concerns addressed during our NSTP journey is the issue of Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC), 
        a pervasive social ill that continues to affect many lives. Through our culminating activities, we explored the legal framework and initiatives that work towards eliminating this form of violence, specifically focusing on Republic Act 11313, also known as the "Safe Spaces Act."
        RA 11313, enacted in 2019, aims to protect individuals&ndash;especially women, children, and the LGBTQ+ community&ndash;from various forms of harassment, including catcalling, stalking, and other forms of gender&ndash;based violence in public spaces.
        This law is crucial in creating a safer environment where people can walk, work, and socialize without fear of harassment or abuse. As NSTP students, we participated in awareness campaigns and discussions on how RA 11313 can help prevent violence and promote gender equality. 
        We also learned about the different forms of VAWC&ndash;physical, emotional, and psychological abuse&ndash;and the importance of providing support to victims. It is vital to break the cycle of abuse, and initiatives like the Safe Spaces Act are a step forward in addressing this issue at a societal level. 
        Our culminating activity allowed us to reflect on how collective efforts, through education, legal frameworks, and advocacy, can help combat violence against women and children. By understanding and implementing the provisions of RA 11313, we are contributing to the creation of a safer and more inclusive society for all.
